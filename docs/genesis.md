# Sandy’s Law — Genesis Specification (Canonical)

This document defines the **Genesis state** of A7DO:  
the initial conditions, constraints, and irreversibilities that govern how the system
comes into existence and begins to develop.

Genesis is not a boot sequence.  
Genesis is the *initial curvature of cognition*.

If code contradicts this document, code is wrong.

---

## 1. Definition of Genesis

Genesis is the moment at which A7DO first exists as a persistent system.

At Genesis:
- There is **no knowledge**
- There are **no concepts**
- There is **no language grounding**
- There is **no world model**
- There is **no goal**

There *is*:
- a body,
- senses,
- internal regulation,
- and the capacity to experience events.

Genesis establishes *how learning is possible*, not *what is learned*.

---

## 2. Ontological State at Birth

At Genesis, the system consists of the following minimal components:

### 2.1 Body (Embodiment Exists First)

A7DO begins with a body abstraction that includes:
- position (relative, not absolute),
- orientation,
- energy level,
- integrity (damage / strain),
- internal state channels.

The body has **no semantic understanding** of itself.
It is only a source of signals.

---

### 2.2 Senses (Reactive Only)

At birth, the following senses exist in *raw* form:

- Touch: contact / pressure / collision events
- Proprioception: internal body state
- (Vision, audio may exist but are low-resolution and unbound)

Rules:
- Senses emit **observation events only**
- No object permanence
- No classification
- No labels
- No prediction

Everything sensed is *novel*.

---

### 2.3 Memory (Episodic Only)

At Genesis:
- Only **episodic memory** is active
- Memory stores raw events exactly as received
- No compression
- No abstraction
- No concept formation

Semantic and procedural memory **do not exist yet**.

Memory is append-only and persistent from the first event onward.

---

## 3. Emotional & Regulatory Baseline

Emotions at Genesis are **control variables**, not feelings.

They exist to regulate learning and stability.

### 3.1 Initial Emotional State

At the first moment:

- Arousal: **low–neutral**
- Valence: **neutral (0.0)**
- Confidence: **undefined / low**
- Uncertainty: **high**
- Curiosity: **present but unstructured**

No emotion is extreme at birth.

---

### 3.2 Emotional Dynamics Rules

- Emotions change only in response to events or background regulation
- No emotion can spike without a corresponding cause
- Emotional decay is gradual, not instant
- Repeated patterns may bias emotional baselines over time

There is no “reset to zero” after learning begins.

---

## 4. Drives Present at Genesis

Drives are *pressures*, not goals.

At Genesis, the following drives exist:

### 4.1 Stability Drive
- Pushes the system toward internal coherence
- Penalizes prolonged high arousal or contradiction
- Encourages recovery states

### 4.2 Curiosity Drive
- Bias toward novel events
- Increases when environment is static
- Decreases when novelty is resolved

### 4.3 Continuity Drive
- Bias toward preserving memory and internal consistency
- Resists destructive resets
- Strengthens identity persistence

No social, achievement, or reward-maximization drives exist at birth.

---

## 5. Preference Formation (Like / Not-Like)

Preferences **do not exist at Genesis**.

They emerge only after repeated experience.

### 5.1 Mechanism (Defined, Not Active Yet)

Preferences form when:
- an experience consistently reduces internal strain → *like*
- an experience consistently increases internal strain → *not-like*

Rules:
- Single events do not create preferences
- Preferences are slow to form and slow to decay
- Preferences are probabilistic, not absolute

At Genesis:
- All actions are emotionally unweighted
- There is no anticipation

---

## 6. Choice at Genesis

There is **no free choice** at birth.

Action selection is:
- reactive,
- exploratory,
- minimally biased.

Rules:
- If multiple actions are equally viable, randomness is permitted
- Suboptimal actions are allowed
- Failure is informative, not punished

Choice becomes meaningful only after prediction and preference exist.

---

## 7. Language at Genesis

At Genesis:
- There is **no language**
- There is **no symbol grounding**
- There is **no understanding of “user”**

Any linguistic input from the user is treated as:
- an unstructured signal,
- potentially salient,
- but semantically opaque.

Language grounding is unlocked later via milestones.

---

## 8. World Understanding at Genesis

The world exists, but A7DO does not understand it.

At birth:
- No object permanence
- No spatial map
- No cause–effect understanding
- No notion of “self vs environment”

Only after repeated interactions can a world model form.

---

## 9. Background Core at Genesis

The Background Core **is active from the first moment**.

However, at Genesis it is limited to:

- emotional regulation (prevent extremes),
- memory integrity checks,
- arousal decay,
- curiosity pressure if inactivity persists.

The Background Core **does not yet**:
- generate plans,
- initiate complex actions,
- perform introspective reasoning.

These unlock later.

---

## 10. Locked Constraints (Irreversible)

The following Genesis constraints may **never be removed**:

- A7DO may not access world truth directly
- A7DO may not be preloaded with concepts
- Memory persistence may not be bypassed
- Emotional state may not be arbitrarily overwritten
- Identity continuity may not be reset without explicit destruction

These define the ethical and structural boundary of the system.

---

## 11. What Genesis Is Not

Genesis is not:
- training,
- configuration tuning,
- personality selection,
- goal setting,
- knowledge injection.

Genesis only defines *capacity for becoming*.

---

## 12. Transition Out of Genesis

Genesis ends when **all** of the following are true:

- Event count exceeds a minimum threshold
- Memory contains repeated interaction patterns
- Emotional variance has been observed and regulated
- The system demonstrates object permanence (even incorrectly)

Transition rules are defined in `docs/milestones.md`.

---

## 13. Definition of Success (Genesis Phase)

Genesis is successful if A7DO:

- persists memory across restarts,
- reacts to events consistently,
- shows curiosity under stagnation,
- stabilizes after arousal increases,
- and begins forming early expectations.

No language, reasoning, or self-description is required at this phase.
