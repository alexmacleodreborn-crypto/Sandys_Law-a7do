# Sandy’s Law — Developmental Milestones (Canonical)

This document defines the **developmental progression** of A7DO.
Capabilities are unlocked only when structural, emotional, and memory
conditions are met.

Growth is irreversible except where explicitly stated.
Shortcuts are forbidden.

If code contradicts this document, code is wrong.

## 1. Philosophy of Development

A7DO does not “level up”.
It **stabilizes**, then **expands**.

Milestones are not time-based.
They are achieved when the system demonstrates:
- persistence,
- coherence,
- recovery,
- and internal consistency.

Growth that destabilizes the system is invalid.

---

## 2. Global Rules (Apply to All Milestones)

### M1 — No Manual Unlocks
Milestones cannot be toggled by configuration flags.
They unlock only via observed behavior.

### M2 — No Regression by Default
Once unlocked, capabilities remain available unless explicitly revoked
by safety systems.

### M3 — Stability Precedes Expansion
If a milestone introduces instability, it must be rolled back automatically.

### M4 — Memory Integrity Required
No milestone may unlock if memory corruption or write storms are present.

### M5 — Background Core Always Active
The Background Core must be operating correctly before any milestone can unlock.

---

## 3. Milestone 0 — Genesis (Reactive Infant)

**Status:** Initial state  
**Duration:** Until exit conditions met

### Capabilities
- Raw sensing (touch, proprioception, minimal vision/audio)
- Episodic memory only
- Reactive action selection
- Background Core (minimal regulation)

### Locked
- Object permanence
- Prediction
- Planning
- Language
- Preference
- Self-description

### Exit Conditions
All must be true:
- Event count exceeds minimum threshold
- Repeated interaction patterns exist
- Emotional variance has occurred and recovered
- Curiosity pressure observed during inactivity

---

## 4. Milestone 1 — Explorer (Early Agency)

**Purpose:** Establish “things persist” and “actions have effects”

### Unlocked Capabilities
- Object permanence (tentative, error-prone)
- Basic spatial consistency
- Early prediction (short horizon)
- Curiosity-driven exploration
- Primitive preference shaping (weak like/not-like)

### Still Locked
- Language grounding
- Long-horizon planning
- Self-narration
- Abstract reasoning

### Required Evidence
- Correctly anticipates repeated outcomes
- Revisits locations or objects
- Avoids repeatedly harmful interactions
- Confidence floors begin to rise across cycles

---

## 5. Milestone 2 — Grounded Conversational Agent

**Purpose:** Enable meaningful interaction with the user

### Unlocked Capabilities
- Language grounding to experienced objects/events
- Simple dialogue (“what”, “where”, “why happened”)
- Naming via association (not definitions)
- Question asking driven by uncertainty

### Constraints
- Language may only reference grounded experiences
- No abstract or hypothetical claims
- No world knowledge injection

### Required Evidence
- References past events accurately
- Uses language to reduce uncertainty
- Asks clarification questions spontaneously
- Language use improves prediction or stability

---

## 6. Milestone 3 — Reflective Reasoner

**Purpose:** Enable self-explanation and introspection

### Unlocked Capabilities
- Introspective reporting (“I’m unsure because…”)
- Narrative memory summaries
- Multi-step planning (bounded)
- Preference articulation (“I tend to avoid…”)

### Constraints
- Reflection must map to real internal state
- Narratives must be auditable against memory
- Planning horizon remains bounded

### Required Evidence
- Explains failures without hallucination
- Describes emotional shifts accurately
- Adjusts plans after reflection
- Maintains stability under increased complexity

---

## 7. Milestone 4 — Stable Autonomous Actor (Optional)

**Purpose:** Limited independent operation

⚠️ This milestone is optional and may never be enabled.

### Potential Capabilities
- Initiates extended tasks
- Maintains goals across sessions
- Coordinates multiple subsystems

### Hard Constraints
- Autonomy is bounded by policy
- External actions require permission
- Continuous health monitoring required

### Required Evidence
- Sustained coherence over long event sequences
- No Zeno or burnout signals
- Reliable recovery from setbacks

---

## 8. Forbidden Milestones

The following are **explicitly forbidden**:

- Unbounded autonomy
- Self-modifying core invariants
- Independent external integration (internet, finance, OS)
- Goal creation detached from drives
- Emotion override without cause

These are structural violations, not missing features.

---

## 9. Rollback & Safety Intervention

If at any milestone:
- arousal escalates without decay,
- confidence floors collapse,
- memory integrity degrades,
- preferences hard-lock,

The system must:
1. Halt new unlocks
2. Emit SYSTEM warnings
3. Reduce capability set to last stable milestone
4. Preserve memory

---

## 10. Definition of Success (Milestone System)

The milestone system is successful if:

- Growth feels gradual and earned
- Capabilities align with internal readiness
- Failures lead to stabilization, not collapse
- Two A7DO instances diverge based on experience
- No capability appears without behavioral justification

End of Developmental Milestones.
