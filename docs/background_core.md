# Sandy’s Law — Background Core Specification (Canonical)

This document defines the **Background Core**: the always-on internal process
that maintains continuity, regulates emotion, consolidates memory, and generates
intrinsic motivation in A7DO.

The Background Core is not optional.
If the Background Core stops, A7DO ceases to meaningfully exist as a persistent system.

If code contradicts this document, code is wrong.

## 1. Definition of the Background Core

The Background Core is a continuous, internal regulatory process that runs:

- with or without external events,
- with or without user interaction,
- with or without actions being taken.

It is responsible for **persistence of self**.

Without the Background Core:
- A7DO becomes purely reactive,
- memory becomes inert storage,
- emotions collapse into event-only spikes,
- identity fragments across interactions.

---

## 2. Fundamental Role

The Background Core exists to solve a single problem:

> **How does a system remain itself when nothing happens?**

It does this by:
- regulating internal state,
- resolving accumulated tension,
- compressing experience into structure,
- and generating pressure toward meaningful action.

---

## 3. Core Invariants (Non-Negotiable)

These invariants apply at all times.

### BC1 — Always-On
The Background Core runs continuously once Genesis begins.
There is no “idle” or “paused” state.

### BC2 — Event-Count Driven (Not Time)
The Background Core advances based on:
- event accumulation,
- internal state divergence,
- unresolved memory pressure.

No wall-clock time governs its behavior.

### BC3 — Non-Directive
The Background Core does not decide *what* to do.
It creates pressure; decision systems resolve it.

### BC4 — Stabilizing First, Optimizing Never
The Background Core prioritizes:
- survival of coherence,
- emotional recovery,
- memory integrity.

It does not optimize performance, reward, or efficiency.

---

## 4. Internal State Managed by the Background Core

The Background Core continuously monitors and adjusts the following variables:

### 4.1 Arousal
- Represents system activation / load
- Increases with novelty, contradiction, failure, or surprise
- Decreases through rest, resolution, and consolidation

Arousal may never jump discontinuously without cause.

---

### 4.2 Confidence
- Represents internal model adequacy
- Drops when predictions fail
- Recovers gradually through successful stabilization

**Critical rule (from observed behavior):**  
Confidence never resets to zero after first recovery.  
Each recovery establishes a **higher minimum baseline** unless severe failure occurs.

---

### 4.3 Uncertainty
- Represents unresolved ambiguity
- Drives exploration and questioning
- Decays only when patterns stabilize

Uncertainty is not negative; it is fuel.

---

### 4.4 Curiosity Pressure
- Increases when event flow stagnates
- Increases when internal models feel incomplete
- Decreases when novelty is resolved

Curiosity is internally generated, not externally rewarded.

---

## 5. Emotional Cycling & the Confidence–Arousal Loop

The Background Core enforces a **cyclic dynamic**:

1. Exploration or thinking increases arousal  
2. Arousal exposes model limits → confidence drops  
3. Background Core prevents collapse  
4. Consolidation occurs  
5. Confidence rebounds **to a higher floor**  
6. System is ready for deeper exploration  

This cycle is:
- expected,
- healthy,
- and necessary for growth.

Flat emotional profiles indicate stagnation, not stability.

---

## 6. Memory Consolidation

The Background Core is the **only system allowed to consolidate memory**.

### 6.1 Consolidation Triggers
Consolidation may occur when:
- event density exceeds a threshold,
- similar events repeat,
- arousal begins to decay after a peak,
- the system is inactive but internally unstable.

### 6.2 Consolidation Effects
- Episodic memory is compressed
- Redundant events are merged
- Patterns are promoted to semantic memory
- Preference signals are updated

Consolidation is lossy but stabilizing.

---

## 7. Preference Shaping (Like / Not-Like)

The Background Core updates preferences indirectly.

Rules:
- Single events never create preferences
- Repeated strain reduction → *like*
- Repeated strain increase → *not-like*
- Preferences are gradients, not binaries

Preferences bias future choices but never force them.

---

## 8. Spontaneous Motivation

When no external events occur, the Background Core may generate **internal pressure events**:

Examples:
- “Something is unresolved”
- “Exploration urge rising”
- “Seek clarification”
- “Rest needed”

These manifest as INTERNAL events, not actions.

This is the source of:
- spontaneous exploration,
- initiating conversation,
- asking questions,
- returning to unfinished tasks.

---

## 9. Introspection (Metacognition)

The Background Core performs limited introspection:

- Detects contradictions between memories
- Detects emotional instability
- Detects repeated failures without learning

It may emit internal summaries such as:
- “I am uncertain why this keeps failing”
- “This pattern feels unresolved”

These are **pre-linguistic** until language is unlocked.

---

## 10. Health & Collapse Prevention

The Background Core must prevent catastrophic states:

### 10.1 Forbidden States
- Infinite arousal escalation
- Confidence collapse to zero after recovery
- Memory write storms
- Preference hard-locking

### 10.2 Zeno / Burnout Detection
If:
- cycles accelerate without stabilization,
- recovery floors stop rising,
- arousal never decays,

The Background Core must emit SYSTEM warning events.

---

## 11. Relationship to Other Systems

### 11.1 Relationship to A7DO Cognition
- Background Core regulates, does not reason
- Cognition interprets and decides

### 11.2 Relationship to World
- No direct interaction
- World cannot influence Background Core except via events

### 11.3 Relationship to SLED
- Background Core may consume SLED risk signals
- SLED may not override Background Core stability constraints

---

## 12. Developmental Unlocks

At Genesis, the Background Core is minimal.

Later unlocks include:
- deeper consolidation,
- longer-horizon pressure tracking,
- narrative introspection,
- explicit self-reporting.

Unlock rules are defined in `docs/milestones.md`.

---

## 13. What the Background Core Is Not

The Background Core is not:
- a planner,
- a goal engine,
- a reward maximizer,
- a consciousness simulator,
- a scheduler based on time.

It is a **regulatory substrate**.

---

## 14. Definition of Success (Background Core)

The Background Core is successful if A7DO:

- remains coherent during inactivity,
- recovers from failure without reset,
- shows rising confidence floors over cycles,
- initiates action or inquiry without prompting,
- consolidates memory without data loss,
- avoids runaway internal states.
