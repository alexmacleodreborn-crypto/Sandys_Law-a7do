# Sandy’s Law — A7DO System

This repository contains a unified artificial organism and decision framework
designed to explore how intelligence, preference, emotion, and agency emerge
from structure, persistence, and experience.

The system combines:
- A7DO: an embodied, developmental AI with background cognition
- World: an objective environment with no built-in semantics
- SLED: a phase- and entropy-based decision engine
- A shared event and memory substrate

The project prioritizes learning over training, persistence over reactivity,
and safety, explainability, and bounded autonomy throughout.
